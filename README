    Laika sending some notification mails on behalf of the MIRA Jeugdkern governance

A little app for sending notification emails. Reads and parses the attendance file 
for the event of the current month and sends out an email to those who haven't yet
filled out.

`node index.js --email <somevalid-mailaddress>`
